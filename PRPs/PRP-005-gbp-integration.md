# PRP-005: Google Business Profile Integration

**Task ID**: PRP-005  
**Wave**: P1 (Priority 1 - Core Assessment Features)  
**Status**: new  
**Estimated Effort**: 21 development hours  
**Dependencies**: PRP-002 (Assessment Orchestrator)  

## Business Logic

### Goal
Implement Google Business Profile (GBP) API integration to extract local presence data for businesses being assessed in the audit platform. This integration provides critical local SEO insights that directly impact the $399 audit report value proposition.

### Business Context
Local presence optimization is a key differentiator in digital marketing audits. GBP data extraction enables comprehensive local SEO analysis, helping businesses understand their local search visibility and competitive positioning. This feature directly supports the premium audit pricing model by providing actionable local optimization insights.

### Data Extraction Requirements
- **Business Hours**: Complete weekly schedule in structured JSON format
- **Review Metrics**: Total review count, average rating (1-5 scale), review velocity
- **Visual Assets**: Photo count and categorization (interior, exterior, product, team)
- **Operational Status**: Current open/closed status and business operational state
- **Recent Activity**: Reviews from last 90 days for trend analysis
- **Location Verification**: Address accuracy and geographic validation

### Success Metrics
- **Match Accuracy**: 80%+ successful business matching rate
- **API Performance**: Maintain 10 QPS rate limit compliance
- **Cost Efficiency**: Track and optimize API costs using tiered pricing model
- **Data Completeness**: Extract minimum 5 core data points per business
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for ambiguous or missing profiles

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
```python
# Google Places API Integration
class GBPIntegrator:
    """Handles Google Business Profile data extraction with fuzzy matching."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, rate_limiter: RateLimiter):
        self.places_client = GooglePlacesClient(api_key)
        self.rate_limiter = rate_limiter
        self.fuzzy_matcher = BusinessMatcher()
    
    async def extract_business_data(self, business_info: BusinessInfo) -> GBPData:
        """Extract GBP data with fuzzy matching and validation."""
        # Implementation details in acceptance criteria
```

### Integration Points
1. **Assessment Orchestrator**: Celery task integration for async processing
2. **Business Matching**: Fuzzy string matching with confidence scoring
3. **Rate Limiting**: 10 QPS compliance with exponential backoff
4. **Data Storage**: Normalized GBP data schema with historical tracking
5. **Cost Tracking**: Per-search cost monitoring and budget controls

### API Configuration
```python
# Google Places API Settings
GOOGLE_PLACES_CONFIG = {
    'base_url': 'https://places.googleapis.com/v1',
    'search_endpoint': '/places:searchText',
    'rate_limit': 10,  # QPS (project-level)
    'field_mask': 'places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.rating,places.userRatingCount,places.currentOpeningHours,places.photos',
    'timeout': 30,  # seconds
    'retry_attempts': 3,
    'backoff_factor': 2.0,
    'monthly_budget_limit': 5000  # USD budget cap
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Google Places API 10 QPS limit may constrain high-volume processing
- **Matching Accuracy**: Fuzzy matching may produce false positives for similar business names
- **API Costs**: $0.017 per search could accumulate quickly with large datasets
- **Data Quality**: Incomplete or outdated GBP profiles may impact audit quality

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Distributed Processing**: Implement queue-based processing to manage rate limits
- **Confidence Scoring**: Use multi-factor matching with confidence thresholds
- **Cost Controls**: Implement daily/monthly budget limits with alerting
- **Fallback Data**: Provide alternative data sources when GBP unavailable

### Dependencies
- **PRP-002**: Assessment Orchestrator must be completed for Celery task integration
- **Google API Access**: Valid Google Cloud project with Places API enabled
- **Rate Limiting Infrastructure**: Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting
- **Database Schema**: Updated schema for GBP data storage and retrieval

## Success Criteria
